# Time-Series-Stock-Forecasting

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using advanced time series forecasting techniques. Historical stock data for selected companies is analyzed and modeled using both traditional statistical methods and modern machine learning approaches.

The primary objective is to understand the patterns in stock market behavior — such as trend, seasonality, and volatility — and use that understanding to make informed predictions.

The models applied include:
-Facebook Prophet for additive forecasting with trend and seasonality
-SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) for classical seasonal time series modeling
-(Optional: LSTM for deep learning-based sequence modeling)

The project follows a structured pipeline:
-Collect 5+ years of historical daily stock data
-Preprocess and clean the dataset
-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-Forecast future prices using Prophet and SARIMA
-Evaluate performance using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE
-Visualize trends, seasonal patterns, and forecasted results

This end-to-end pipeline helps in understanding how various time series models perform under real financial data and lays the foundation for practical forecasting applications in the stock market.
